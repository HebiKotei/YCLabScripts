# YCLabScripts

Hello all,

These repository will become the home of plenty of scripts to help with people compounding uncertainties for their lab experiments in Physics. There will be some specific scripts for some experiments fitting the Leybold Didactic Scripts, in which a lot of universities use. There will also be some general, some simple, that will do the trick for most applications.

This was developed for use on Spyder. Providing that you have the required packages, you should be able to run these scripts on any python IDE.
