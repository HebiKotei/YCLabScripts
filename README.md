# YCLabScripts

Hello all,

These repository will become the home of plenty of scripts to help with people compounding uncertainties for their lab experiments in Physics. There will be some specific scripts for some experiments fitting the Leybold Didactic Scripts, in which a lot of universities use. There will also be some general, some simple, that will do the trick for most applications.

These will start off to be run within Spyder, Anaconda, but will work in other dev environments as long as it has a console. If these gain a few more downloads, I'll see about making them a bit less... well, scripty.
